      <p> <bold>UI/UX</bold>
        UI stands for User Interface, and involves evaluating what users’ needs are in order to provide as rich a usability experience 
        as possible.  UX is the all-encompassing concept of User Experience. 
        Whereas UI is the means of communication between a visitor and your website, UX is the interaction itself. The act of clicking each 
         of those icons, and scrolling through your news feed. Research shows that usability 
         is the most important factor for customers in determining whether they will use your website or service. </p>
         <p><bold>Bit vs. Byte</bold>
            First of all, it’s important to note that capital B indicates byte, whereas lowercase b indicates bit. There are 8 bits to a Byte. 
            But they each measure different things
            is measured in bits, and data storage is measured in Bytes.</p>
            <p>Web Design vs. Web Development
                It’s important to be aware of the differences between web designers and web developers. 
                The former are responsible for the aesthetic look and feel of a web project, 
                whereas the latter actually build the site. Both use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Ajax, 
                but developers go deeper in the language of the Internet. .</p>

              <p>CMS
                  A Content Management System enables you to compose and upload content to your website. 
                  Intechnic equips its websites with an easy-to-use 
                  CMS that lets you manage your site without any complicated coding or even outside assistance. </p>
<p>Top-level Domain
    Your domain name is what allows your site to be referenced on the Internet. 
    “Google.com,” “WhiteHouse.gov,” and “Harvard.edu” are all domain names. 
    Additional examples include: 
     .net for networking companies, ISPs, and web hosting companies; .org for non-profits .me for personal sites 
    .info for information sites .biz for businesses and .mil for military institutions.</p>
    <p>Dynamic Content
        Ideally, all the content on your website will be dynamic in the sense that it’s engaging to consumers. 
        But the term “dynamic” in a web development context refers specifically to the interactive features on a website. </p>
